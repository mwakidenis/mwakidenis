✅ This version is fully GitHub Markdown-compatible. No HTML tags that would break rendering.

If you want, I can also enhance this README with:

Gradient-style headers using shields

Badges for each skill/tech (rendered as images)

Hoverable pseudo-animation links

This will make it look modern and more “3D-inspired” even without live JS.

Do you want me to create that next?
